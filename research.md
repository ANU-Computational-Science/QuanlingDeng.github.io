## Research interests
- Mathematical modeling and simulation: fluid flow through poroelastic media, ocean and atmosphere dynamics, sea ice floe dynamics.

- Scientific computing and numerical analysis: parallel computing, preconditioners, post-processing, PDE numerical solvers such as FDM, FVM, FEM, IGA, DG, HHO, Runge--Kutta methods, and generalized-alpha methods, operator splitting schemes, dispersion and spectral analysis, a priori and a posteriori error analysis.

- Uncertainty quantification and data assimilation: stochastic models, Kalman filters, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

- Artificial intelligence and machine learning: particle swarm optimization, physics-informed neural networks, supervised learning.
